								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/workout.jpg" alt="" /></a>

							<p>My interest in massage therapy birthed a few years after obtaining personal training certifications (NASM) where I directed much of my focus on corrective flexibility. Over the years, I've become familiar with the integrity of soft tissue, muscles and their fascia (connective tissue ) and how together their dynamic relationship functions to either promote or prevent optimal movement. From there I took action in further advancing my trade by pursuing a license in soft tissue manipulation in 2013.  Since then I've dedicated my specialties to corrective, performance, and maintenance therapeutic massage through a wide variety of clinical modalities.</p>
							<p>I genuinely want people to be able to live life to their earnest and fullest potential. Whether playing sports, an instrument or playing with your kids/dogs, etc., freedom in movement is living and I focus my practice and skills on helping individuals achieve functional movement. Whether developing a short term treatment plan or continued maintenance, my goal as a massage therapist is to ensure every person I work with is free to live their life with unrestricted movement!</p>

							<ul>
								<li>"Excellent pre marathon massage. Kari helped me with my hip and low back pains, plus put my shoulder on the right place!" ~ Marcela O., Brazil</li>
								<li>"Kari was fantastic. Her active release techniques were very effective, she was super knowledgeable about addressing some unique challenges I have, and she was incredibly professional and personable." ~ Dave A., Austin, TX</li>
								<li>"I've been dealing with a lot of tightness through my neck and shoulders, along with some nerve pain in my extremities related to a neck injury. I just happend to find Form + Function on Google while staying at a nearby hotel and decided to get some work done yesterday. Kari is absolutely amazing. She did a lot of manipulations and active release techniques that are uncomfortable in the moment, but so effective. I woke up this morning with my neck and shoulders feeling looser, and with a better range of motion than I've had in years. She's also just a fun person to spend an hour with - very interesting and great personality. Kari is the best massage therapist I've ever visited. If you have pain and stiffness, see her ASAP." ~ David Walker, San Marcos, TX</li>
								<li>"My friend and I booked 90 minute deep tissue treatments on short notice. My therapist was Kari and she was incredibly skilled with a very diverse therapeutic background and it was evidenced in my results. I've dealt with sciatica for almost 20 years and she stretched me in ways never before experienced that were instant relief. The rest of her deep tissue and breathing assisted work was also unique in my experience and completely relaxing." ~ Mike B., El Cerrito, CA</li>
